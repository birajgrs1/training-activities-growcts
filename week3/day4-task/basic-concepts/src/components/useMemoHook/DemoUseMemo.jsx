/*
UseMemo is a hook that allows us to memoize, in other words cache, a value of a calculation. 
This means, we donâ€™t need to recalculate the value, unless any of its dependencies change.

As a result, this improves performance. However, we should be careful not to overuse useMemo, as React
already has some efficient optimizations for re-renders in place. So when should we use it?

Use useMemo only when recalculating a value is a computationally expensive process which can impede 
performance.

Syntax

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
The first argument is a function that returns the computed value.
The second argument is an array of dependen
