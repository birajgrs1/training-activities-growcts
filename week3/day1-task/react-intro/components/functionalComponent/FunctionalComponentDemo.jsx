/*
ReactJS functional components are JavaScript functions that return a JSX element, which is a 
template used to define the componentâ€™s structure. 
JSX looks similar to HTML, but it has a special syntax that lets it be converted into JavaScript code.

Stateless (before hooks): Originally, functional components were stateless and used only for rendering 
UI based on props.
Simpler Syntax: They are defined as JavaScript functions, leading to cleaner and more readable code.
Return JSX: Functional components return JSX (a syntax extension that allows HTML-like code inside
JavaScript).
No, this keyword: Unlike class components, functional components do not have a this context.
Hooks: With hooks, functional components can manage state and side effects, making them just as 
powerful as class components.
